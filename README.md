## Under the hood

Articles / Jobs are fetched using the public [HN API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) every 4 hours by a couple of Firebase cloud functions. The Cloud Functions then scrap the webpages of the articles to obtain images and descriptions of the articles. The result of this is then stored into Firebase Firestore which the app uses to display the articles / jobs.
